# myportolio backend study
## myportfolio will be a social network project for designers, developers, art creators

###### Project will be done under MERNStack Technology and will be a SPA

### Technologies :
* MERNStack
* PWA with the help of React
* Real-Time parts (currently with the help of Long Polling)
    * In some parts, I will try to use socket.io
    * Because MongoDB started to support GraphQL, I may also convert the project from REST to GraphQL and hence I can start to use subscriptions of GraphQL

This is just the backend part of the project, a good part of the FrontEnd completed in React and for Global State, Redux has been used


#### For run the program, add default.json file to config folder and add the following :

``` {
  "mongoURI": "ADD YOUR MONGO DB URI",
  "jwtSecret": "Create Your jwtSecret Key",
  "sendGridAPIKeyId": "Add Your send Grid API key Id",
  "sendGridAPIKey": "Add Your Send Grid API Key"
} 
```
